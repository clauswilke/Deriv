Version 1.1
===========

* 2015-01-29
 - Deriv() is now the only entry point for all expressions to derive. No more need for Deriv.function() which is suppressed
 - In addition to previously possible derivation of functions and expressions, the argument to derive can be submitted as
  * character string, e.g. '"x**2"'
  * right hand side of a formula, e.g '~ x**2'
  * quote() call, e.g 'quote(x**2)'
 - Power expression is allowed to have symbolic power, e.g. 'x**n' or 'x^n'
 - Simplifications are pushed further for rational expressions (i.e. having terms united by '*' and/or '/'), all numeric terms are explicitly calculated and identical terms in numerator and denominator are simplified
 - auxiliary functions like neg.sin() or reciprocal() are replaced by their explicit counterparts in the final result
 - added tan() to the table of derivable functions
 - some unit tests are added for Deriv() and Simplfy()(based on testthat package)

Version 1.0
===========

* 2014-12-10
 - Andrew Clausen passed the maintenance to Serguei Sokol
 - Serguei Sokol has fixed a bug in simplification of "a-b"
 - revamped the documentation and code as an R package
 - put the code to GitHub https://github.com/sgsokol/Deriv
 - submitted the package to CRAN

* 2009-2-21 Mark Reid's patch

* 2007 Andrew Clausen has written an original code Deriv.R and Simplify.R
 distributed on his site https://andrewclausen.net/computing/deriv.html
